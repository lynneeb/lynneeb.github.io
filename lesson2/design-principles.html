            <p>The principle of repetition is an organizational technique that creates consistency throughout the design. Elements are repeated within the project, creating a sense of oneness. This Apple image demonstrates the principle of repetition. The bubbly style and bright colors are duplicated on the iPad as well as on the advertisement behind it. It is effective in catching your eye and holding your attention. </p>

            </picture>
            <p>The principle of contrast organizes the design with visual hierarchy. A stark change between two elements grabs the eye of the reader. The contrast in this Tiffany & Co. advertisement is very alluring. The picture of the classy woman in the black dress next to the bright blue background is very effective in drawing your attention to the gold jewlery. It suggest to the mind that a person will look sophistaced by buying and wearing the rings.</p>

            <p>The principle of proximity groups related items together. This IHOP flyer is a great example of proximity. Your eyes move to the top of the page where, "Kids Eat Free" captures your interest. Relative information is grouped just underneath the heading. Likewise, throughout the page, content with similar information is placed within the same area. This design showcases an organized and easy-to-read page.</p>
