      <p>Greetings to you all! I am excited to begin this web design class.</p> 
      <p>Here's a little about me. I have lived in Arizona all my life. I am married and have a large family. I like to swim, read novels, and listen to inspirational music. I enjoy going walking with a friend, watching a good rodeo, or camping with my family. I love watching my children play sports, perform in their choir or band concerts, or act in a play. My children are my greatest treasure!</p>
      <p>My major is Computer Information Technology. I want to be a computer programmer and design web pages.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho, is their online degree plans. I am able to take classes from my home and complete my assignments around my schedule. I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>Knowing how to program, design web pages, and work with computers will give me a great advantage within the work force.  Since almost all industries rely upon computers to do their job efficiently, those who have a degree in the computer field are in high demand.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is:
      Proverbs 3:5-6
      "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
      In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."</p>
