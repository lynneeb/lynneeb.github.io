            <h2>Website Colors</h2>

            <p>The color scheme for the <strong>Forecast For Fun</strong> weather website is similar to those found in nature. 
                Visitors who will come to this site love the outdoors and will feel a connection to this color palette. 
                The cool sky blue and warm earth tones will speak peace and comfort to them. 
                This color combination will draw in those who love being out in nature. 
                It will entice them to go outside and have some fun!<br><br>

                One of the most important design aspects of a website is its colors. 
                Having the right color scheme will attract viewers. 
                It demonstrates a high-quality website and is pleasant to the eye. 
                The right colors send a strong message of professionalism. 
                Potential customers will take notice and return to <strong>Forecast For Fun</strong> for accurate weather forecasting.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Warm colors</strong> such as red, orange, and yellow send a message of warmth. 
                These sunny colors often bring with them feelings of joy and happiness.<br><br>

                <strong>Cool colors</strong> like blue, purple, and green are associated with the feelings of cold weather. 
                These colors create a professional and corporate look, stirring up emotions of trust and authority.<br><br>

                <strong>Neutral colors</strong> such as brown and gray donâ€™t stir up much emotion, because they are neither hot nor cold.<br><br>

                Understanding the power of color and the emotion they invoke, allows the designer to relay a message without the use of words. 
                An experienced designer deliberately chooses a certain color scheme to attract the target audience.<br><br>
